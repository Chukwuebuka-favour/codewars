Description:

Kata Task
I have a cat and a dog.

I got them at the same time as kitten/puppy. That was humanYears years ago.

Return their respective ages now as [humanYears,catYears,dogYears]

NOTES:

humanYears >= 1
humanYears are whole numbers only
Cat Years
15 cat years for first year
+9 cat years for second year
+4 cat years for each year after that
Dog Years
15 dog years for first year
+9 dog years for second year
+5 dog years for each year after that

# MY SOLUTION
def human_years_cat_years_dog_years(human_years):
    i = 1
    cat_years, dog_years = 0,0
    while i <= human_years:
        
        if i == 1:
            cat_years += 15
            dog_years += 15
        elif i == 2:
            cat_years += 9
            dog_years += 9
        else:
            cat_years += 4
            dog_years += 5
            
        i+=1
        
    return [human_years,cat_years, dog_years ]

# ALTERNATIVE SOLUTION
def human_years_cat_years_dog_years(x):
    return [x, 24+(x-2)*4 if (x != 1) else 15, 24+(x-2)*5 if (x != 1) else 15]
